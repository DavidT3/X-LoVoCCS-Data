# X-LoVoCCS-Data
This repository contains the code and information used to create the multi-mission X-ray data archive for the Local Volume Complete Cluster Survey (LoVoCCS). Also included are limited data visualisations, not specific to any one analysis.

The LoVoCCS sample file will be stored in its own repository at some point, so the sample_files section might be empty until a clone is done from that sample repository


## GIVE CREDIT
i.e. Agrim did the XMM inspection etc. - obviously he is also on the paper, but I should make it explicit
